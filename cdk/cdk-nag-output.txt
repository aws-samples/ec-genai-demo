All Warnings:
AwsSolutions-CFR1: The CloudFront distribution may require Geo restrictions. Geo restriction may need to be enabled for the distribution in order to allow or deny a country in order to allow or restrict users in specific locations from accessing content.
AwsSolutions-CFR2: The CloudFront distribution may require integration with AWS WAF. The Web Application Firewall can help protect against application-layer attacks that can compromise the security of the system or place unnecessary load on them.
All Errors:
AwsSolutions-VPC7: The VPC does not have an associated Flow Log. VPC Flow Logs capture network flow information for a VPC, subnet, or network interface and stores it in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Flow log data can help customers troubleshoot network issues; for example, to diagnose why specific traffic is not reaching an instance, which might be a result of overly restrictive security group rules.
AwsSolutions-IAM4[Policy::arn:<AWS::Partition>:iam::aws:policy/TranslateFullAccess]: The IAM user, role, or group uses AWS managed policies. An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. Currently, many AWS managed policies do not restrict resource scope. Replace AWS managed policies with system specific (customer) managed policies.This is a granular rule that returns individual findings that can be suppressed with 'appliesTo'. The findings are in the format 'Policy::<policy>' for AWS managed policies. Example: appliesTo: ['Policy::arn:<AWS::Partition>:iam::aws:policy/foo'].
AwsSolutions-IAM5[Resource::*]: The IAM entity contains wildcard permissions and does not have a cdk-nag rule suppression with evidence for those permission. Metadata explaining the evidence (e.g. via supporting links) for wildcard permissions allows for transparency to operators. This is a granular rule that returns individual findings that can be suppressed with 'appliesTo'. The findings are in the format 'Action::<action>' for policy actions and 'Resource::<resource>' for resources. Example: appliesTo: ['Action::s3:*'].
AwsSolutions-ECS4: The ECS Cluster has CloudWatch Container Insights disabled. CloudWatch Container Insights allow operators to gain a better perspective on how the cluster’s applications and microservices are performing.
AwsSolutions-ECS2: The ECS Task Definition includes a container definition that directly specifies environment variables. Use secrets to inject environment variables during container startup from AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or Secrets Manager instead of directly specifying plaintext environment variables. Updates to direct environment variables require operators to change task definitions and perform new deployments.
AwsSolutions-IAM5[Resource::*]: The IAM entity contains wildcard permissions and does not have a cdk-nag rule suppression with evidence for those permission. Metadata explaining the evidence (e.g. via supporting links) for wildcard permissions allows for transparency to operators. This is a granular rule that returns individual findings that can be suppressed with 'appliesTo'. The findings are in the format 'Action::<action>' for policy actions and 'Resource::<resource>' for resources. Example: appliesTo: ['Action::s3:*'].
AwsSolutions-ELB2: The ELB does not have access logs enabled. Access logs allow operators to to analyze traffic patterns and identify and troubleshoot security issues.
AwsSolutions-CFR3: The CloudFront distribution does not have access logging enabled. Enabling access logs helps operators track all viewer requests for the content delivered through the Content Delivery Network.
AwsSolutions-CFR4: The CloudFront distribution allows for SSLv3 or TLSv1 for HTTPS viewer connections. Vulnerabilities have been and continue to be discovered in the deprecated SSL and TLS protocols. Help protect viewer connections by specifying a viewer certificate that enforces a minimum of TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 in the security policy. Distributions that use the default CloudFront viewer certificate or use 'vip' for the 'SslSupportMethod' are non-compliant with this rule, as the minimum security policy is set to TLSv1 regardless of the specified 'MinimumProtocolVersion'.
AwsSolutions-CFR5: The CloudFront distributions uses SSLv3 or TLSv1 for communication to the origin. Vulnerabilities have been and continue to be discovered in the deprecated SSL and TLS protocols. Using a security policy with minimum TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 and appropriate security ciphers for HTTPS helps protect viewer connections.
